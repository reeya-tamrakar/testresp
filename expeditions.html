              A trip to Everest Base Camp is on the bucket list for many
              adventurous nature lovers. Far from an ordinary trip, this
              majestic trek will introduce travelers to new challenges with
              every turn. Resting just below the Khumbu Glacier, Everest Base
              Camp is well-known worldwide and is an essential landmark in any
              geography lesson. The Everest Base Camp Trek is an adventure that
              allows travelers to glimpse life in the Himalayas and experience
              the tallest peak in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              People have been fascinated by Mount Everest for centuries, with
              Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa successfully being the
              first to summit the mountain in 1953 successfully. Since then,
              hundreds of travelers have flocked to Nepal every year to see the
              mountains that have captured the hearts and minds of so many
              people throughout history.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 16-day Everest Base Camp Trek is not simply a regular tour but
              an experience of a lifetime. You will spend your days walking
              along rugged Himalayan trails with views of snow-capped mountains,
              icy glaciers, and Sherpa heritage. You will also be introduced to
              some of the worldâ€™s highest mountains, including Mount Everest,
              Lhotse, Nuptse, Ama Dablam, and Cho Oyu, to name just a few.
              Furthermore, you will be able to experience the Sherpa lifestyle
              and grow to appreciate their exceptional hospitality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every step of your Trek to Everest Base Camp will be incredible,
              beginning with the scenic flight from Kathmandu to Lukla. The
              30-minute flight will treat you to views of lush green Himalayan
              forests and snow-capped peaks. With a runway of only 527 meters
              long, the Tenzing-Hillary Airport has one of

              I had always wanted to do the Everest Trek, and when I finally had
              the opportunity, I was delighted with enthusiasm! I think I am
              also fortunate to have been in the company of Nepal Hiking Team
              because they gave me no reason whatsoever to companion about
              anything at all.

              Every service I received was top-notch, and I was always provided
              the best available services, from the food and guesthouses to the
              porter and guiding services
